"Like all cryptography-based privacy-preserving computing systems, SCQL at"

msgid ""
"The multi-query attack method includes two attack ways: (1) One way to "
"obtain the other party's information is to tamper with the input content "
"for each query, while keeping the query itself unchanged. For example, "
"the attacker can obtain all the information of the other party's join key"
" through multiple join queries and tampering with the content of his join"
" key each time. (2) Another way is to infer the other party's private "
"data by rewriting the query each time and comparing the results of "
"multiple queries. For example, the attacker can use the where condition "
"to limit the input of the aggregation function. The first time the query "
"obtains the aggregation result of N pieces of data, the second time by "
"changing the where condition, the aggregation result of N-1 pieces of "
"data can be obtained, and then the attacker can obtain the original "
"information of 1 piece of data by comparing results."
msgstr ""
"多次查询攻击方法包含两种攻击方式： (1) 一种方式是查询语句不变，每次查询时篡改输入内容的方式来获取对方信息。比如攻击者可以通过改变自己 "
"join key 的内容，多次枚举查询来获得对方 join key 的全部信息。 (2) "
"另一种方式是通过改写每次查询语句，对比多次查询结果来推测对方的隐私数据。比如攻击者可以利用 where 条件限制聚合函数的输入，第一次查询获得 N"
" 条数据的聚合结果，第二次通过改变 where 条件，获得其中 N-1 条数据的聚合结果，对比结果可以获得其中 1 条记录的明文数据信息。"

"original data."
msgstr ""
